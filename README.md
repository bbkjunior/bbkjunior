Hello! 

My name is Nikolay Babakov. I am a PhD student at University of Santiago de Compostelo.

I am interested in NLP and everything about it. My current research is Natural Lnaguage Generation for Bayesian Networks reasoning.
My recent research was dedicated to toxicity detection and text style transfer.

You may reach me in telegram [@bbkjunior](https://t.me/bbkjunior).

Models you may like:
-
- [Russian Sensitive Topics Classifier](https://huggingface.co/apanc/russian-sensitive-topics) - model for detecting flammabel/senstitve topics (e.g. racism, drugs, terrorism, etc.)
- [Russian Inappropriate Utterances Classifier](https://huggingface.co/apanc/russian-inappropriate-messages) - model for detecting nontoxic but still inappropriate messages 
- [Mutual Implication Score](https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/Mutual_Implication_Score) - symmetric measure of text semantic similarity based on a RoBERTA model pretrained for natural language inference and fine-tuned on a paraphrase detection dataset
- [GenChal_2022_nigula](https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/GenChal_2022_nigula) - the model gets the English text with the error and the exact span of the error and should return the comment in natural language, which explains the nature of the error.
- [LEWIP-informal](https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/LEWIP-informal) - model designed to transfer formal text into informal keeping the important slots from the source text. The slots can be either pre-defined or detected automatically.


Competitions:
- 
- Second place (team nigula) at [GenChall2022](https://fcg.sharedtask.org/results/) - task dedicated to generating feedback to the English phrases containing errors.
