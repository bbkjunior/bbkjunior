Hello! 

My name is Nikolay Babakov. I am a PhD student at University of Santiago de Compostelo.

I am interested in NLP and everything about it. My current research is Natural Lnaguage Generation for Bayesian Networks reasoning.
My recent research was dedicated to toxicity detection and text style transfer.

- [Russian Sensitive Topics Classifier](https://huggingface.co/apanc/russian-sensitive-topics) - model for detecting flammabel/senstitve topics (e.g. racism, drugs, terrorism, etc.)
- [Russian Inappropriate Utterances Classifier](https://huggingface.co/apanc/russian-inappropriate-messages) - model for detecting nontoxic but still inappropriate messages 
- [Mutual Implication Score](https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/Mutual_Implication_Score) - symmetric measure of text semantic similarity based on a RoBERTA model pretrained for natural language inference and fine-tuned on a paraphrase detection dataset
- [LEWIP-informal](https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/LEWIP-informal) - model designed to transfer formal text into informal keeping the important slots from the source text. The slots can be either pre-defined or detected automatically.
